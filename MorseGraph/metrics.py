Metrics for comparing Morse graphs and their basins of attraction.

This module provides functions to evaluate the accuracy and topological similarity
of computed Morse graphs against ground truth, including:
- Region of Attraction (RoA) accuracy via Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Graph structure comparison via edit distance and isomorphism
- Algebraic topology comparison via Betti numbers
